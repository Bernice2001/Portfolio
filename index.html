        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
   <p>I was born and raised in Nairobi,Kenya.I am 18 years of age.
        I started school in the year 2005 at <em>Happyland Schools</em> in 
        Buruburu.An year later I was moved to Riara Springs Group 
        Of Schools.In 2014 January I started boarding school at 
        Brookfield Academy.I sat for my K.C.P.E there where I 
        performed fairly well.Later on I moved to Mahiga Girls 
        Highschool.Four years later I did my K.C.S.E and performed
        equally well.In 2020 January I joined K.C.A University where
        I did my short course called I.C.D.L.Unfortunately a pandemic
        broke out In March where we forced to stop going to school.
        Since the pandemic looked as if it will take long,I decided to
        research about a software development school where i found 
        <em>Moringa School.</em>I really got interested and dug deeper to know 
        more about the school.I did the July intake where I got 
        enrolled I was really excited because I knew i would gain a lot!
